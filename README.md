A number of performance improvements, including support for native lazy loading of images and fonts, and a new cache invalidation mechanism.
New Image Component
The new Image component is a major improvement over the previous Image component. It is more performant, more accessible, and easier to use.

The new Image component ships less client-side JavaScript, which can improve performance. It is also easier to style and configure, and it requires alt tags by default, which improves accessibility.

The new Image component also aligns with the Web platform, which means that it can take advantage of native lazy loading. This can further improve performance by only loading images that are visible on the screen.

New Font System
The new font system is a major improvement over the previous font system. It is more performant, more secure, and easier to use.

The new font system automatically optimizes your fonts, including custom fonts. It also removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance.

The new font system also has built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means that you can host your fonts on your own server, which can further improve performance and security.

New App Router
The new App Router is a major improvement over the previous router. It is more flexible, more powerful, and easier to use.

The new App Router allows you to define routes in a more flexible way. You can now define routes based on dynamic values, such as the current user or the current time.

The new App Router is also more powerful. It allows you to intercept requests and modify them before they are routed to a page. This can be used to implement features such as authentication and authorization.

The new App Router is also easier to use. It provides a number of new features that make it easier to define and manage routes.

Support for native lazy loading of images and fonts
